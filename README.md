This was made for the Soft152 module as part of my degree.

# Usage
* Program can be ran in Visual Studio or through the executable file within the bin/debug folder.
* When running the user can click on a district to have its name and attached neighborhoods be populated. 
* Neighborhoods and Properties will then work similarly with the districts attached to a neighborhood appearing once the neighborhood is presssed.
* The user can type into the box to either add a new entry into the list or edit the currently selected one. Or they can delete the selected one. Note that all child entries such as Districts or properties will be deleted in this process.
* Properties can also be searched up using parameters such as name or price.
